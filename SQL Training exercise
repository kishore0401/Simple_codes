Table Alias - logically name the table alias with 3 to 5 characters

Select td.name
,td.weight
from total_data as td

######################
The spaces are not recognized in the SQL or ETL manager, if we want spaces in the column names, use "Holy Hell" instead of Holy_Hell column name

DISTINCT statement have to be added in the beginning, after the SELECT statement to list out all the DISTINCT entries

#Comparision operators

= , !=, >=, <=, IN () operator includes all the values

BETWEEN   AND  

NOTE : OR operator**** - this is a risky operator which can make your other where conditions go away
So always use OR operator conditions inside ()

Like operator 

Some column entries will have null values. In order to ignore it, use IS NOT NULL function

NVL function replaces the null value with the value you provide

NVL(TT, 0) 

##########################

AGGREGATE Functions - 

Column PARTITION by functions.
The partition function is a filter criteria for a column in a table that will reduce the Query run time and more efficient way of writing 

COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG

COUNT(DISTINCT DS.TABLENAME)


GROUP BY clause is used when there is an aggregate function used and all the non aggregate columns have to go in there

So use the having clause in order to specify the aggregated column to have a definite value

##########################

SYSDATE ---- always use Trunc(sysdate) - which gives you only the date formatting 



JOIN CASES

INNER Join - This join function uses the rows which are matching the criteria frm 2 or more tables

OUTER Join - It gets either all the data from one or more tables
Left join - Gets all the info from left table and selected information from the right table

Right Join - all from right table and matching columns from the left

Full Join - It grabs the all the rows from the 2 or more table
